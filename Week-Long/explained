I wanted to do a giftable hack for Cirill. It seemed like it was only yesterday when we first met at HobbyHacks, but after months of chatting, joking around, and
sending each other terrible memes, here we are today. Unfortunately, since my coding isn't that great, my gift probably won't be as impressive as the ones that others built for 
their recipients. But it's the thought that counts, right? Eheh, anyways, regardless of if you like it or not, just take it as a token of appreciation from me for being such a funny, talented individual
and a wonderful, amazing friend! 

This app generates random art ideas. If you don't like the default one, you can click the button and generate another one! If you go through it enough times, you'll notice that 
there's two categories: general and specific. General ideas are just objects, while specific ideas pertain to characters from popular TV shows, books, movies, etc. There's even a 
Phineas and Ferb theme for both categories! Well, the whole app is Phineas and Ferb themed, so...have fun! :P
