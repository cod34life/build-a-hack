One of Day 3's challenges was "Create a list sorter". Since they didn't specify what kind of list sorter (numbers or words), my program can do either. It can also go on 
for as long as you want it to, just in case you have multiple lists you want sorted, and talk to you. Think of Stori as a Siri knockoff.
